Jackie "Moms" Mabley
March 19, 1894 â€“ May 23, 1975
born Loretta Mary Aiken 
born in Brevard, North Carolina
At the age of 14 with the encouragement of her grandmother, Loretta ran away to Cleveland, Ohio, joining a traveling vaudeville-style minstrel show starring Butterbeans and Susie, where she sang and entertained.
Loretta Aiken took her stage name, Jackie Mabley, from an early boyfriend.
Later she became known as "Moms" because she was indeed a "Mom" to many other comedians on the circuit in the 1950s and 1960s.
She came out as a lesbian at the age of twenty-seven, becoming one of the first openly gay comedians.
Mabley was one of the most successful entertainers of the Chitlin' circuit of African-American vaudeville.
At the height of her career, she was earning US$10,000 a week at Harlem's Apollo Theater.
In the 1960s, she became known to a wider white audience, playing Carnegie Hall in 1962, and making a number of mainstream TV appearances, particularly her multiple appearances on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour when that CBS show was number one on television in the late 1960s
Mabley was one of the top women doing stand-up in her heyday, eventually recording more than 20 albums of comedy routines.
She appeared in movies, on television, and in clubs.
Mabley was billed as "The Funniest Woman in the World".
She tackled topics too edgy for most mainstream comics of the time, including racism.
Her (completely serious and melancholy) cover version of "Abraham, Martin and John" hit #35 on the Billboard Hot 100 on 19 July 1969. At 75 years old, Moms Mabley became the oldest living person ever to have a US Top 40 hit. 
She persisted for more than sixty years.
She is the subject of Whoopi Goldberg Presents Moms Mabley, a documentary film which first aired on HBO on November 18, 2013. Link: http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/whoopi-goldberg-presents-moms-mabley
